# Rice Seed Phenotyping Dataset

## Overview
This dataset was provided by the **Rice Research Institute of the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences**. It contains high-resolution images of rice grains for phenotyping studies and classification tasks.

- **Rice variety:** Tongjing 612
- **Experimental design:** Nine field management combinations involving straw incorporation, enzyme application, and various combinations of organic and chemical fertilizers (see Table 1).
- **Image acquisition:** Nikon D7100 camera under uniform black background and standardized lighting, resolution 6000×4000 pixels (300 dpi).
- **Grains per image:** 200
- **Purpose:** Phenotypic variation analysis, rice grain classification, and computer vision model development.
